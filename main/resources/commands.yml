#  BetterDonutTeams Command Configuration
# ----------------------------------------------------
#  This file controls which commands are active on your server.
#  It allows you to choose a primary command (like /guild or /clan)
#  and have all other alternatives act as aliases.
#
#  How it works:
#  The plugin registers all commands listed in plugin.yml (team, guild, clan, party).
#  The settings below determine which one becomes the "main" command.
#  All other commands will simply execute the primary one.
#  This system gives you full control over how your players interact with the plugin.
#
#  Example: If you set primary-command to "guild", then running /team, /clan, or /party
#  will function exactly as if the player had typed /guild.
# ----------------------------------------------------

#  primary-command:
#    This is the main command players will use.
#    Valid options are: team, guild, clan, party
primary-command: "team"

#  primary-message-command:
#    This is the main command for sending team chat messages.
#    Valid options are: teammsg, guildmsg, clanmsg, partymsg
primary-message-command: "teammsg"
