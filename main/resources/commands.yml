#        BetterDonutTeams Command Configuration        #
# ---------------------------------------------------- #
# This file controls which commands are active on your server.
# It allows you to choose a primary command (like /guild or /clan)
# and have all other alternatives act as aliases.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# The plugin registers all commands listed in plugin.yml (team, guild, clan, party).
# The settings below determine which one becomes the "main" command.
# All other commands will simply execute the primary one.
# This system gives you full control over how your players interact with the plugin.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# If you set primary-command to "guild", then running /team, /clan, or /party
# will function exactly as if the player had typed /guild.
# ---------------------------------------------------- #

# primary-command:
#   This is the main command players will use for general team management.
#   It's recommended to choose ONE and leave it.
#   Valid options are: team, guild, clan, party
primary-command: "team"

# primary-message-command:
#   This is the main command for sending team chat messages.
#   It's recommended to choose ONE and leave it.
#   Valid options are: teammsg, guildmsg, clanmsg, partymsg
primary-message-command: "teammsg"
